				<p>Certified as a Nutrition Consultant, and a Health Coach, I help women optimize their health and
					wellness, by finding their UNIQUE nutritional and lifestyle approach. I’m a proud, born and raised
					Honduran, dedicated and committed to continuous learning and Self-Development.</p>
				<p>I struggled with a hormonal imbalance, PCOS, throughout my teenage years and as a young adult.
					Picture embarrassing, facial cystic acne, periods that came only 2-4 times a year, ovaries
					permanently outlined with the famous “pearl” cysts, weight fluctuations. I also suffered through
					years of painful hip osteoarthritis, accompanied by days-long flares and a surgery done to try and
					correct a lesion, which really only accelerated the deterioration of my already worn out hip.</p>
				<p>Several years ago, I turned to functional medicine, and anti-inflammatory foods and lifestyle, and
					embarked on a never-ending learning and coaching journey. It became my passion, my purpose, my most
					meaningful job.</p>
				<p>Now? I live without the PCOS symptoms that haunted me for years, and I thrive with advanced hip
					Osteoarthritis. I manage both without ANY medication, through intentional and consistent habits and
					non-negotiables of eating, living, and supplementing. No hip replacement surgery any time soon for
					this lady!!</p>
				<p>I was never told that <b>nutrition</b> and <b>lifestyle</b> were the KEY players in allowing me to
					live with a debilitating joint condition, without having to run after my doctor for pain medication,
					or that they were essential to helping me resolve PCOS symptoms.</p>

				<h2>The second part of my WHY</h2>
				<p>Four years ago, I went through traumatic, frustrating, recurrent pregnancy losses, followed by
					intense grief. Through doing the intentional work of healing, I took a different decision, with the
					support of my husband. Honoring my true self and the choice taken, I am set to creating a childfree
					life to love and enjoy. We’re a couple without children: sparked by circumstances and fueled by
					certainty and conviction.</p>
				<p>My views and personal beliefs on health and prevention were shattered. I felt broken. For a while I
					believed I had failed myself, and therefore was not capable or enough to speak, educate and coach on
					health and wellness. I almost gave up my most meaningful life’s work, and I’m glad I did not. I
					worked with an amazing coach and other professionals who helped turn my perspective and reality
					around.</p>
				<p>Trauma broke me in pieces AND it also challenged me to transform myself.<br />
					Grief brought heartache AND it also gave me empathy and a need for deeper work and learning.<br />
					Loss brought pain AND it made me a stronger woman.
				</p>
				<p>My health habits and skills provided a desire to prioritize myself, learn more and help wonderful and
					committed people.</p>

				<p>I actively pursued RESILIENCE. The key here is ACTIVELY.</p>
				<p>Turns out, I WAS ENOUGH. Enough to teach and coach, enough to learn, enough to help my clients.</p>
				<p>I developed a framework which led (first) me, and then my clients, to improve their nutrition and
					health.</p>
				<p>I studied, prepared, created and implemented simple, applicable wellness actions to ensure going from
					symptoms and imbalance, to healthier and amazing in a short number of weeks.</p>
				<p>No, you don’t need fad and fashionable diets to achieve health. You need a healthy lifestyle created
					BY you and FOR you.</p>
				<p>Wellness gives no space to perfection, it focuses on abundance and taking daily imperfect actions.
				</p>
				<p>You apply intentionality, purpose and consistency to develop habits and skills that sustain your
					nutrition, and make your body resilient and immune-strong, for the present and the future.</p>
				<p>YOU uncover and define your WHY.</p>
				<p>You learn and empower yourself with knowledge about your body and health. You learn to become
					self-aware.</p>
				<p>You listen to your body’s cues and messages, and proactively seek to live an anti-inflammatory
					lifestyle, without obsession or perfection, but with everyday mindful, self-compassionate decisions.
				</p>
				<p>You mindfully eat, move, sleep, rest and heal to live an amazing life now and in the decades ahead.
				</p>
				<p>You focus on your “Health IDentity”: (WHO you want to become health-wise) in place of “Health goals”
					(WHAT you are trying to achieve). Your Health ID (motivations, deep-rooted desires, long-term health
					vision, willingness and commitment, habits) guides you in determining your health goals.</p>
				<p>You invest in your health: Time, Energy, Resources, Space, YOU.</p>
				<p>So, tell me.. What is that new Health ID you are looking to become?</p>
				<p>Are you ready, willing and motivated to do the work of optimizing yourself, prioritizing and saying
					YES to yourself? </p>
				<p>It sounds like YOU are ready. The good news is: you’re in the right f#*g place.</p>
				<p>Vamos y Hagamos!</p>
