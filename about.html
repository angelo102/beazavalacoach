				<p>Certified as a Nutrition Consultant, and an experienced Health Coach, <b>I help women optimize their
						health and wellness, by finding their UNIQUE nutritional and lifestyle approach</b>. I’m a
					proud, born
					and raised Honduran, dedicated and committed to continuous learning and Self-Development.</p>

				<p>I struggled with a hormonal imbalance, PCOS, throughout my teenage years and as a young adult.
					Picture embarrassing, facial cystic acne, periods that came only 2-4 times a year, ovaries
					permanently outlined with the famous “pearl” cysts, weight fluctuations. I suffered years
					of painful hip osteoarthritis, accompanied by days-long flares and a surgery done to try and correct
					a lesion, which really only accelerated the deterioration of my already worn out hip.</p>

				<p>Several years ago, I turned to functional medicine and nutrition, I focused on whole foods, a more
					active and
					intentional lifestyle, and embarked on a learning and coaching journey.</p>

				<p>Now? I live without the PCOS symptoms that haunted me for years, and I thrive, despite having
					advanced hip
					Osteoarthritis. I manage both without ANY medication, committing to intentional and consistent
					habits and non-negotiables of eating, living, and supplementing. No hip replacement surgery any time
					soon for this lady!!</p>

				<p>I was never told that nutrition and lifestyle modifications were KEY in allowing me to live with a
					debilitating joint condition, nor having to run for pain medication. As a teenager and young adult,
					I was never told they were essential to helping me resolve and overcome my PCOS symptoms! Sadly,
					this is a reality for many women.</p>

				<p>I’ve been there. I’ve had my symptoms dismissed, and told I would have to live that way. That the
					only solution for me, was going on the pill. I chose food and lifestyle, and never looked back.</p>

				<h2>My WHY doesn’t stop there</h2>

				<p>Four years ago, I went through traumatic, recurrent pregnancy losses, followed by intense grief.
					Through doing the work of healing, I took a different road. We decidedly became a couple without
					children: sparked by circumstances, and now fueled by conviction, joy and the desire to create a
					life we both love.</p>

				<p>My views and personal beliefs on health and prevention were shattered. I felt broken. For a while I
					believed I had failed myself, and therefore was not capable or enough to speak, educate and coach on
					health and wellness. I almost gave up my most meaningful life’s work, and I’m glad I didn’t. I
					worked with an amazing coach and other professionals who helped turn my perspective and reality
					around.</p>

				<p>You see, the same as with food and lifestyle, I was never told that I had options. That motherhood
					was only ONE of many beautiful choices, not an obligation I had to comply with, or check off a box.
				</p>

				<p>I set off to actively pursue RESILIENCE in all forms: physical, mental, emotional, nutritional. The
					key here is ACTIVELY. </p>

				<p>No, you don’t need fad and fashionable diets to achieve health. You need a healthy lifestyle created
					BY you and FOR you.</p>

				<p>Wellness gives no space to perfection, it focuses on abundance and taking daily IMPERFECT actions.
					You apply
					intentionality, purpose and consistency to develop habits and skills that sustain your nutrition,
					and make your body
					resilient and immune-strong.</p>

				<p>YOU uncover and define your WHY.</p>

				<p>You learn and empower yourself with knowledge about your body and health. You learn to become
					self-aware.</p>

				<p>You listen to your body’s cues and messages, and proactively seek to live an anti-inflammatory
					lifestyle, without obsession or perfection, and with everyday mindful, self-compassionate decisions.
				</p>
				<p>You GET TO mindfully eat, move, sleep, rest and heal to live an amazing life now and in the decades
					ahead.</p>

				<p>You invest in your health: Time, Energy, Resources, Space, Emotions, YOU.</p>

				<p>So, tell me...</p>

				<p>Are you ready, willing and motivated to do the work of optimizing yourself, prioritizing and saying
					YES to yourself?</p>

				<p>It sounds like YOU are ready. The good news is: you’re in the right f#*g place.</p>

				<p>Vamos y Hagamos!</p>
