								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="templates/stellar/images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<!-- <h2>Magna feugiat lorem</h2> -->
								<p>I’m a born and raised Honduran, certified Nutrition Consultant, and a Health Coach helping people optimize their health through individualized coaching and education on blood sugar management and its importance in relation to chronic disease, sleep hygiene, stress management, weight, gastrointestinal issues, thyroid health and hormonal balance, and other metabolic imbalances such as PCOS, high blood pressure and high lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides). </p>
								<p>I struggled with hormonal imbalances, and other health issues through my teenage years and beyond. Picture embarrassing, facial cystic acne, periods that came only 2-4 times a year, ovaries permanently lined with the famous “pearl” cysts, continuous weight fluctuations, painful hip arthritis, accompanied by days-long flares and a surgery done to try and correct a lesion within, which really only accelerated the deterioration of my already worn out hip. </p>
								<!-- <h2>Tempus veroeros</h2> -->
								<p>Several years ago, I turned to functional medicine, and anti-inflammatory foods and lifestyle, and embarked on a never-ending learning and coaching journey. It became my passion, my purpose, my most meaningful job.</p>
								<p>Now? I live without the PCOS symptoms that haunted me for years, and I thrive with advanced hip Osteoarthritis. I manage both without ANY medication, through intentional and consistent habits and non-negotiables of eating, living, and supplementing. No hip replacement surgery any time soon for this lady!!</p>
								<p>I was never told that <b>nutrition</b> and <b>lifestyle</b> were the KEY players in allowing me to live with a debilitating joint condition, without having to run after my doctor for pain medication, or that they were essential to helping me resolve PCOS symptoms.</p>
							
								<h2>The second part of my WHY</h2>
								<p>Four years ago, I went through traumatic, frustrating, recurrent pregnancy losses, followed by grief and a road to healing and transforming.</p>
								<p>My views and personal beliefs on health and prevention were shattered. I felt broken. For a while I believed I had failed myself, and therefore was not capable or enough to speak, educate and coach on health and wellness. I almost gave up my most meaningful life’s work, and I’m glad I did not. I worked with an amazing coach and other professionals who helped turn my perspective and reality around.</p>
								<p>Trauma broke me in pieces AND it also challenged me to transform myself.<br>
									Grief brought heartache AND it also gave me empathy and a need for deeper work and learning.<br>
									Loss brought pain AND it made me a stronger woman.
								</p>
								<p>My health habits and skills provided a desire to prioritize myself, learn more and help wonderful and committed people.</p>

								<p>I actively pursued RESILIENCE. The key here is ACTIVELY.</p>
								<p>Turns out, I WAS ENOUGH. Enough to teach and coach, enough to learn, enough to help my clients.</p>
								<p>I developed a framework which led (first) me, and then my clients, to improve their nutrition and health.</p>
								<p>I studied, prepared, created and implemented simple, applicable wellness actions to ensure going from symptoms and imbalance, to healthier and amazing in a short number of weeks.</p>
								<p>No, you don’t need fad and fashionable diets to achieve health. You need a diet created BY you and FOR you.</p>
								<p>Wellness gives no space to perfection, it focuses on abundance and taking daily imperfect actions.</p>
								<p>You apply intentionality, purpose and consistency to develop habits and skills that sustain your nutrition, and make your body resilient and immune-strong, for the present and the future.</p>
								<p>You find and define your WHY.</p>
								<p>You learn and empower yourself with knowledge about your body and health. You learn to become self-aware.</p>
								<p>You listen to your body’s messages, and proactively seek to live an anti-inflammatory lifestyle, without obsession or perfection, but with everyday mindful decisions. </p>
								<p>You mindfully eat, move, sleep, rest and heal to live an amazing life now and in the decades ahead.</p>
								<p>You focus on your “Health IDentity” (WHO you want to become health-wise) in place of “Health goals” (WHAT you are trying to achieve) your goals and change your health identity.</p>	
								<p>You invest in your health. Time, energy, resources, space, yourself.</p>	
								<p>So, tell me.. What is that new Health Identity you are looking to become?</p>	
								<p>Are you ready, willing and motivated to do the work of optimizing yourself, prioritizing and saying YES to yourself? </p>
								<p>It sounds like YOU are ready. The good news is: you’re in the right f#*g place.</p>
								<p>Vamos y Hagamos!</p>
