				<p>Why is it that we get excited and energized when initially trying to make changes in our eating and
					living patterns, only to falter and crash after a short time or trying? What if I told you what you
					thought, and have been told over and over, is your own “damn self-control” really is: not having
					sustainable habits unique FOR YOU, an environment that facilitates your goals and ambitions, and a
					mindset that supports your health vision.</p>


				<p>You know what, I call BS on all that “self-control” and “willpower” crap, and let’s wake up to the
					fact that our bodies are amazing at guiding us to health and cueing us in… we just need to learn how
					to listen and act from a self-compassionate and individualized approach.</p>

				<p>Have you been finding yourself navigating endless amounts of nutrition and wellness information to
					make healthier food and lifestyle choices, only to end up either more confused, overwhelmed, or have
					lost invaluable time, effort and energy in the process?</p>

				<p>Please keep reading, because I want to make sure your time is no longer inadequately invested, and
					you start NOW taking actions on your health.</p>

				<p>This 1:1 coaching program is not the same as a one-time consulting session. I will take you through 8
					weeks together, where I will empower you with tools such as data-tracking and personalized
					habit-creating methods using:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Functional and personalized nutrition</li>
					<li>Guidance on fitness and movement</li>
					<li>Mindfulness for optimal lifestyle approaches</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Throughout the 8 weeks, you’ll learn, and be guided on the health fundamentals for Preventing,
					Living, and Thriving (not surviving but THRIVING) with:</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>Metabolism and blood sugar related imbalances, induced by diet and lifestyle choices, such as
						insulin resistance (hello many PCOS warriors), pre-Diabetes and Diabetes (have a family
						history?)</li>
					<li>Belly fat and weight struggles</li>
					<li>Endocrine (hormonal) imbalances and concerns (PCOS, thyroid health, period problems, chronic
						stress symptoms</li>
				</ul>

				<p>And expressions of the above:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Cravings and extreme hungers (hangry anyone?)</li>
					<li>Fluctuating energy levels – low (or non-existent) in the morning, slumps in the afternoon, need
						naps after meals.</li>
					<li>Brain fogs, inability to focus and can’t understand why (running for caffeine early morning or
						mid-afternoon?!)</li>
					<li>Easy weight gain – have tried different things, only to see it back in no time.</li>
					<li>Sleep issues?</li>
					<li>Inconsistent moods throughout the day, or from one day to the next.</li>
					<li>Elevated: cholesterol, triglycerides, A1C, fasting sugars or insulin, or other metabolic and
						hormonal markers.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Nutrition and Health Coaching with me, are ideal for you, if you:</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>Are in need of support, education and guidance around chronic health issues mentioned previously
					</li>
					<li>Have struggled with and are looking to improve: digestive issues, weight and fat gain
						(especially abdominal), immune system (get sick often?)</li>
					<li>Are tired of all the health and wellness sh*t out there </li>
					<li>Are ready to ditch all the dieting, detoxes, cleansing and restriction non-sense,
						because you’re looking for a lifestyle of health, a new Health Identity, not a miracle or quick
						fix.</li>

					<li>Want to dive in and do the work of discovering and learning about yourself, your body</li>
					<li>Feel excited about using your motivations and vision to work with me in upping your
						health-habits game!</li>
					<li>Are a determined person when it comes to improving your health and find it exciting to try out
						different methods or approaches to find a unique and balanced lifestyle that works for you.</li>
					<li>Are ready to learn, practice and engage in blood sugar data-tracking, if considered to be
						beneficial to your situation specifically</li>
				</ul>


				<h2>What is included in your 8 weeks?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>1 weekly 70-minute call + 1 wrap-up call at the end of the program = 9 calls total or 10.5 hours
						of coaching calls.</li>
					<li>Unrestricted questions and communication via email</li>
					<li>Do-it-yourself worksheets, created for you to work on yourself as we move through the program
					</li>
					<li>Handouts specific to the weekly learnings, for your reference and future</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>PAY–IN–FULL BONUS!</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>2 (optional) 30-minute check-in calls, to be used within the following 3 months after the end of
						our time together, at your preferred time.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Or</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>1 hour deep-dive call (to be used within the following 3 months) if needing additional support.
					</li>
					<li>15% off of regular price</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Are you ready to create your new Health Identity using Food and Lifestyle habits?!</p>
				<p>Great!! Vamos y Hagamos!</p>

				<p>Next steps!</p>

				<p><b>Step 1</b>. I’d love for us to have an exploratory, brief, no-strings-attached call, where we will both
					see if we’re a good match! Please use the calendar below to schedule in your best time, and I will
					send the details for our call afterwards.</p>
				<p>If you prefer skipping the call, and would like more details about the program, please send me “I’d
					like more information about the program!” at beazavala.coach@gmail.com. I’ll be happy to send you a
					form for you to fill out, and we can both see if we’re a good match!</p>
				<p><b>Or</b></p>
				<p>Do you already know you’re ready to join the 1:1 coaching program without the exploratory call?
					Awesome!</p>
				<p><b>Step 2</b>. Email me at beazavala.coach@gmail.com with the words “I’m ready to join your 1:1 Coaching!”,
					and I’ll send you our online payment options (parts and full payment).</p>
