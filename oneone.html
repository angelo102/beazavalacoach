				<p>Why is it that we get excited and energized when initially trying to make changes in our eating and
					living patterns, only to falter and crash after a short time or trying? What if I told you what you
					thought, and have been told over and over, is your own “damn self-control” really is: not having
					sustainable habits unique FOR YOU, and an environment that facilitates your goals and ambitions.
				</p>
				<p>You know what, I call BS on all that “self-control” and “willpower” crap, and let’s wake up to the
					fact that our bodies are amazing at guiding us to health and cueing us in… we just need to learn how
					to listen and act from a self-compassionate and individualized approach. </p>
				<p>Have you been finding yourself navigating endless amounts of nutrition and wellness information to
					make healthier food and lifestyle choices, only to end up either more confused, overwhelmed, or have
					lost invaluable time, effort and energy in the process?</p>
				<p>Please keep reading, because I want to make sure your time is no longer inadequately invested, and
					you start NOW taking actions on your health.</p>
				<p>This 1:1 coaching program will take you through 7 weeks together, where I will empower you with tools
					such as data-tracking and personalized habit-creating methods using:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Functional nutrition</li>
					<li>Guidance on fitness and movement</li>
					<li>Mindfulness and self-compassion for optimal lifestyle approaches</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Throughout the 7 weeks, you will learn, and be guided on the health fundamentals for Preventing,
					Living, and Thriving (not surviving but THRIVING) with:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Metabolism and blood sugar related imbalances, induced by diet and lifestyle choices, such as
						insulin resistance (hello many PCOS warriors), and prediabetes.</li>
					<li>Belly fat and weight difficulties</li>
				</ul>
				<p>And the manifestations of the above mentioned, in the form of:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Frequent cravings and extreme hungers (hangry anyone? – hungry and angry)</li>
					<li>Fluctuating energy levels – low in the morning, slumps in the afternoon, need naps after meals.
					</li>
					<li>Brain fogs, inability to focus and can’t understand why (running for caffeine early morning or
						mid-afternoon?!)</li>
					<li>Easy weight gains – have tried different things, only to gain it back in no time.</li>
					<li>Sleep issues?</li>
					<li>Inconsistent moods throughout the day, or from one day to the next.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Nutrition and Health Coaching are ideal for you if you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Are in need of support, education and guidance around health issues involving blood sugar
						imbalances such as insulin resistance, prediabetes, diabetes or predisposition to it such as is
						the case with unmanaged PCOS symptoms, stress symptoms such as fatigue, declining energy,
						difficulty sleeping and understanding hormonal balance.</li>
					<li>Have struggled with and are looking to improve: digestive issues, weight and fat gain
						(especially abdominal), immune system (get sick often?)</li>
					<li>Are tired of all the amount of health and wellness sh*t out there “available” for you to
						navigate on your own and crave effective connection and accountability to find your unique
						balance.</li>
					<li>Are *effing ready to ditch all the dieting, detoxes, cleansing and restriction non-sense,
						because you’re looking for a lifestyle of health, a new Health Identity, not a miracle or quick
						fix.</li>
					<li>Are ready to dive in and do the work of discovering and learning about yourself, your body, and
						how to find the best food and lifestyle choices for you.</li>
					<li>Feel excited about using your motivations and vision to work with me in upping your
						health-habits game!</li>
					<li>Are a determined person when it comes to improving your health and find it exciting to try out
						different methods or approaches to find a unique and balanced lifestyle that works for you.</li>
					<li>Are ready to learn, practice and engage in blood sugar data-tracking, if considered to be
						beneficial to you specifically. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>What is included in your 7 weeks?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>1 weekly, 1-hour call + 1 wrap-up call at the end of the program = 7 calls total or 7 hours of
						calls</li>
					<li>Unrestricted questions and communication via email</li>
					<li>Do-it-yourself worksheets, created for you to work on yourself as we move through the program
					</li>
					<li>Handouts specific to the weekly learnings, for your reference and future</li>
				</ul>
				<p>PAY–IN–FULL BONUS!</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2 (optional) 30-minute check-in calls, to be used within the following 3 months after the end of
						our time together, at your preferred time. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Or</p>
				<ul>
					<li>1 hour deep-dive call (to be used within the following 3 months) if needing additional support.
					</li>
					<li>15% off of regular price </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Are you ready to create your new Health Identity using Food and Lifestyle habits?!</p>
				<p>Great!! Vamos y Hagamos!</p>

				<p>Step 1. I’d love for us to have an exploratory, brief, no-strings-attached call, where we will both
					see if we’re a good match! Please use the calendar below to schedule in your best time, and I will
					send the details for our call afterwards.</p>
				<p>Or</p>
				<p>Do you already know you’re ready to join the 1:1 coaching program without the exploratory call?
					Awesome! Keep reading:</p>
