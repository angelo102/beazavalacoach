That means you’re searching for an upgraded version of your nutrition and your health.</p> <p>Think about this for a moment: you’re looking at a healthy YOU one year from now…</p> <p>What do you see? What would you want to see?</p> <p>What did you do to achieve that new Health Identity you’re looking at?</p> <p>What would happen if you never take action to become that new YOU?</p> <p>What would you be giving up or losing?</p> <p>Those are powerful questions I ask myself from time to time to evaluate where I am in my health.</p> <p>What kind of transformation am I talking about here? </p> <p>One where you:</p> <ul> <li>Learn more about yourself, factor in your preferences and physiology, and find food and lifestyle choices that benefit and improve your health.</li> <li>Discover the areas of health that are less obvious than food and exercise, but equally important when impacting your whole body. Do you usually find yourself not knowing why you don’t feel better, or lose weight if you’re “already eating healthy and exercising”?</li> <li>Create foundational nutrition and wellness habits, unique to you, using a system that you can easily replicate afterwards.</li> </ul> <h2>Why <b>RESILIENT Nutrition?</b></h2> <p>Resilience is largely defined as the capacity or ability to recover quickly from difficulties, spring back into shape; TOUGHNESS.</p> <p>Basically, it’s the capacity we CREATE to be able to cope when things go wrong, are difficult or not the way we envision it, by using diverse mechanisms, and strength, to help us regain balance and protect our health (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual).</p> <p>Resilience is active, it requires intention and consistency. Forging resilience forces us to stay away from passiveness and insists we take ACTION, by taking ownership of ourselves and our decisions.</p> <p>By viewing Nutrition as RESILIENT we are taking our food and lifestyle choices and habits, and creating them uniquely to our own function. Make them your body’s armor of protection. Give your body the ability to bounce back, or better cope with health struggles that come your way.</p> <p>Do you know if you’re taking actions that build your nutritional resilience, or do your actions destroy it?</p> <p><b>RESILIENT Nutrition</b> program will empower you to understand the factors of optimal health, and how to make them work for hormonal balance, a more flexible metabolism, and the healthy weight and energy you seek:</p> <ul> <li>Self-awareness and Advocacy</li> <li>Food</li> <li>Exercise and Movement</li> <li>Sleep quality</li> <li>Stress and Energy management</li> <li>Mind and Emotions</li> </ul> <p><b>Do you often experience any of the following?</b></p> <ul> <li>Irregular and unpredictable moods</li> <li>Cravings, hungers or the famous “hangry” (cranky, irritable, weak, shaky)</li> <li>Energy slumps, fatigue or brain fog, </li> <li>Struggles with weight, belly fat</li> <li>Sleep problems</li> <li>PCOS symptoms (Insulin Resistance), or period issues</li> <li>Frequently get sick </li> <li>Digestive issues</li> </ul> <h2>Why is this program different? </h2> <p>See if you can relate to any of the following:</p> <ul> <li>You’re overwhelmed by the amount of nutrition information out there, don’t know where to begin or what to do next</li> <li>You are tired of diets and restrictions which only lead you to heavier cravings, quick weight-gain rebounds.</li> <li>You know that food and exercise are important but wasn’t aware they are only 2 of about 6 important pillars of sustainable health and wellness.</li> <li>You want community and connection, accountability, coaching and guidance, because let’s face it, we all need the help. (I myself can’t do it alone, and I don’t attempt to.
