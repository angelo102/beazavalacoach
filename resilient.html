								<p>I’m grateful you’re here. That means you’re searching for an upgraded version of your nutrition and your health.</p>
								<p>Think about this for a moment: you’re looking at a healthy YOU one year from now… </p>
								<p>What do you see? What would you want to see?</p>
								<p>What did you do to achieve that new Health Identity you’re looking at?</p>
								<p>What would happen if you never take action to become that new YOU?</p>
								<p>What would you be giving up or losing?</p>
								<p>Those are powerful questions I ask myself from time to time to evaluate where I am now in my health, who I want to become, and what I need to do to get there. </p>
								<p>They’re aggressive to ponder on, aren’t they? Yet, they’re a truly important starting point. They’re the initial small steps needed to begin a personal transformation of any kind. </p>

								<p>
									What kind of transformation am I talking about here?
									<br> 
									One where you take your actual self, factor in your preferences and physiology, do the work to discover more about your body, which food and lifestyle choices benefit and improve your health, and take that knowledge to the next level into creating your own, unique, habits that make up the foundation of nutritional health and wellness, in 6 weeks.
								</p>

								<p>In this program, we will discover, dig deep and work through six fundamental health habits that make up a solid base of health, using food and lifestyle as the essential workers.</p>
								
								<h2>Why RESILIENT Nutrition?</h2>
								<p>Resilience is largely defined as the capacity or ability to recover quickly from difficulties, spring back into shape; TOUGHNESS. </p>
								<p>Basically, it is the capacity we CREATE to be able to cope when things go wrong, are difficult or not the way we envision it, through using unique mechanisms and strength to help us maintain balance and protect our health (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual)</p>
								<p>Resilience is active, it requires intention and consistency. Forging resilience forces us to stay away from passiveness and insists we take ACTION, by taking ownership of ourselves and our decisions.</p>
								<p>By viewing Nutrition as RESILIENT we are taking our food and lifestyle choices and habits, and creating them uniquely for us, in such a way that they become our body’s armor of protection and provide it with the capacity to bounce back or better cope with the health struggles that come along the way.</p>

								<p>Do you know if you’re taking actions that build your nutritional resilience, or do your actions destroy it?</p>
								<p>RESILIENT Nutrition encompasses factors other than food, which work hand in hand as equal pillars of optimal health:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Self-awareness and Advocacy</li>
									<li>Food</li>
									<li>Exercise and Movement</li>
									<li>Sleep</li>
									<li>Stress and Energy management</li>
									<li>Mind and Emotions</li>
								</ul>

								<p>For radical change, you will learn why we focus on WHO you want to become (Health Identity) in place of WHAT you want to accomplish (Health goals).</p>
								
								<p>This program will empower you to:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Tune in to your body and master self-awareness and self-advocacy for your health.</li>
									<li>Find and detect what I call “food symptoms”.</li>
									<li>
										Learn to use food and life habits to stabilize your blood sugars, prevent or reverse insulin resistance and prediabetes, reduce cortisol (stress hormone), and improve digestion.
										<ul>
											<li>What The eFff Is Insulin resistance you say? Mood issues, cravings, hungers or the famous “hangry” (cranky, irritable, weak, shaky), energy slumps and sleep problems.</li>
											<li>If you have PCOS, Insulin Resistance might possibly be at the base of your symptoms.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Understand how to, and potentially, lose unwanted weight or belly fat</li>
									<li>Power-up your immune system and create a RESILIENT body</li>
									<li>Create a solid base for improved hormonal balance</li>
									<li>Find connection and community with like-minded women </li>
								</ul>
								
								<h2>Why is this program different? </h2>
								<p>See if you can relate to any of the following:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>You’re overwhelmed by the amount of nutrition information out there, don’t know where to begin or what would even be ideal to eat for yourself and your body, and how to live better for health.</li>
									<li>Are tired of diets and restrictions which only lead you to heavier cravings, more weight gain and no knowledge of why.</li>
									<li>You know that food and exercise are important but wasn’t aware they are only 2 of about 6 important pillars of sustainable health and wellness.</li>
									<li>You are looking for community and connection, accountability, coaching and guidance, because let’s face it, we all need the help. (I myself can’t do it alone and I don’t attempt to. Which is why I also work with other coaches to improve my own health!)</li>
									<li>It is directed to women that CAN and DO prioritize and invest in themselves: time, money, effort, energy, love.</li>
								</ul>
